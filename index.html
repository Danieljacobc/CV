            <img src="_____" alt="_____">
        note: 
        - in 'src' we attatch the link to the image and in 'alt' we give the link a related name so google can use it as an alternate path.
        - this only works if the program can ping the hosting websites servers, if the servers are down the image can't be downloaded or displayed resulting in an error.
        - you can make the image available all the time if you download the image, place it in the same folder as the website, and paste image name (look on the left menu for example)
        - you can also make another folder within the folder to put multiple images but it'll have to be put in img src as a path instead of a name

            <ul> - creates an unordered list (requires opening and closing)
            <li> - gives the list a bullet (requires opening and closing)

            <table> - creates a table and ensures proper indentation (opening and closing tag)
            <tr> - creates a table row for our data to go into (opening and closing tags)
            <td> - where we input our data (opening and closing tags)

                also note that tables have sections (thead, tbody, tfoot) - they all require open and closing tags to be able to edit within them 
                <th> - gives us a table header (requires open and closing tags)
                <table border="1"> - you can add a border to a table with this syntax in the opening table element (the number being the size)
